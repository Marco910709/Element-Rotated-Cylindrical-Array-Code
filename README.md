# Element-Rotated-Cylindrical-Array-Code
The codes enclosed is an example of synthesizing a flat-top pattern for a 24-element cylincrical conformal array by optimizing the element rotations and excitation phases, which is just the first example in the article entitled 'Synthesizing Shaped-Beam Cylindrical Conformal Array Considering Mutual Coupling Using Refined Rotation/Phase Optimization' is given as an example.

'MainPro_pos' is the main procedure; 'pso' is the CF-PSO algorithm; 'fit_cal' is used to calculate the fitness function value; 'aff' is used to calculate the array patter; 'rEPhi_VAEP' and 'rETheta_VAEP' are the full-wave simulated two components of the vectorial element patterns.

Identical VAEPs are utilized for all the elements in this example for simplicity, but it is easy to change them to those obtained by full-wave simulating your own antenna array;
